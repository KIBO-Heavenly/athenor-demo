# Environment Configuration for Athenor Demo
#
# NOTE: This is a DEMO VERSION that runs entirely in the browser.
# No backend server or API is required.
# All data is stored in localStorage and uses mock data.
#
# If you want to connect to a real backend, you would set:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
#
# For the demo, no environment variables are needed!
